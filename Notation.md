# Notation

## Key terms

Key terms in the explainers are introduced by making them bold. For instance, the introduction of legacy transaction as a key term would look as follows: **Legacy transaction**. 

Key terms are explicitly defined, unless they are proper names or their meaning is obvious from the discussion. Any definition is usually given upon introduction of a key term, though sometimes it is more convenient to leave the definition until a later point.  


## Emphasized words and phrases

Words and phrases are emphasized via italics. For instance, the phrase "Remember your password" would look as follows: *Remember your password*. 


## Commands

Commands are formatted in bold and monospace, and preceded by "$". The command "$ sudo shutdown" would, for example, look as follows: **`$ sudo shutdown`**.
